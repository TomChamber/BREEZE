What sparked my interest in IT was probably be during my high school year when I was playing the
most games and looking at different unique apps and websites, which sparked my interest in IT and it's
the broad field of study which is very unique and more interesting when compared to different fields of
study. My experience in IT is only what I have experienced during my 2 years of studying IT within the
high school as well as coding and other random stuff I do during my spare time at home on my PC.

During my time at RMIT, I expect to be introduced to different types of programming and to be able to hone my skill as well as experience through my lecturers and have a better understanding of what I will be able to do in the future through completing the course.
