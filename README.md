#### When did your interest in IT start?:
My interest in IT started when I first got my PC which interest me in many different
program and design that was created in order to improve how we use technology which greatly 
interested me in IT at a young age through programs such as C+, which I use through highschool VCE

#### Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT Experience:
What sparked my interest in IT was probably be during my high school year when I was playing the
most games and looking at different unique apps and websites, which sparked my interest in IT and it's
the broad field of study which is very unique and more interesting when compared to different fields of
study. My experience in IT is only what I have experienced during my 2 years of studying IT within the
high school as well as coding and other random stuff I do during my spare time at home on my PC.


#### Why Did you choose to come to RMIT?
I chose RMIT as my place to study and obtain my degree because it is known as the best university for technology when compared to other universities, plus it is really close to the train station which makes it very convincing for me to attend classes.

#### What do the results of these tests mean for you?
These results from the three tests that I have done
 mean that I should try to adjust my daily life to help improve on these
aspects of my personality and to further improve my way of life in the future through the suggested trait that
Has been given to me through the 16 personality tests.


#### How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?
These results will probably not influence my behavior when working as a part of a team
because I won't let my behavior affect my responsibility of contributing my part of work within
a team to help my team finish an assignment, and due to the fact that it is just an online test that will probably
not affect me in any way. 



#### How should you take this into account when forming a team?
When I am forming a team I would take into account my personality and form my team around
My behavior so that I would be able to work effectively in a group which I know that I will
Be able to cooperate more than just going with a random group and hindering me and their ability to 
Complete work.

# Project Idea: Project Breeze

<img src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/raspberry_pi_4_and_logo_hero.jpg?width=1198&trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1" />

#### Overview:  
The purpose of this Raspberry PI automation system which I name “Project Breeze” is to adjust the amount of sunlight and temperature within a certain room or office by using the Raspberry PI as the main computer system “Brain” and connecting it to software that is a java based to allow a small electric motor to adjust the amount of sunlight that is permitted within a certain area by rotating window or curtain to ensure that the amount of sunlight that interacts with the environment is kept to a temperature that the user desire through the software. I was also thinking of connecting a temperature and a small solar panel that will provide the mechanism to be fully functional without the thought of annoying wires, and the temperature will always make sure that the temperature inside the room will always be cooler than what it is outside of the desired environment



#### Motivation: 
My motivation for this project was inspired by my personal experience of how annoying and frustrating it is when my room gets too hot/cold due to the amount of sunlight being permitted inside the room as well as the constant action of adjusting my room temperature through the AC every time the temperature outside changes. This constant struggle which is quite common in Melbourne where the weather is unpredictable was the biggest factor that motivated me into coming up with this idea for my project “Project Breeze”.  “In regional Victoria, 20% of the 413,400 households with air conditioning used it during all summer months, compared to Melbourne's 12% (of 1,010,400 households). A smaller proportion of Victorian households (6%) do not use their air conditioner for cooling at all during the summer months” this is why I believe that “the ventilator” will become a very important mechanism that will help families with and without air conditioner to better keep their household within the desired temperature during Australia harsh weather and could possibly save them a lot of money on there electrical bills.

#### Description: 
The main goal of “Project Breeze” is to be able to achieve the desire of regulating your desired environment through the use of a raspberry pi which can be connected to your AC and a mechanism that will be able to attach to your window that will allow it to be physically controlled by the raspberry pi to help regulate the temperature within the area. The main selling point of the project will be that it is an affordable and easy to use thermometer that can help regulate your house temperature to your desired temperature without you needing to do anything after you have set a desired temperature within the software. When you have set the desired temperature that you would like your home to always be at the program will try its best to control and adjust the AC and window/curtain as much as possible to reach the set goal that has been set through the raspberry pi as the “brain” of the project to enable such action to occur. The solar panel that will be attached to the electrical motor will provide it with an energy source without relying on the customer's home electricity, which makes “project breeze” reliable even when power might not be present, this is important because some houses whole in Australia and commonly in Melbourne experience power outage during the hot summer season due to the power use of power for air conditioning, which is the main unique selling point of my project.

Another aspect of “project breeze” that makes it stand out as a unique invention from anything that has come before it is that it comes with a very reasonable price point for its purpose, due to the component used for it is very affordable, which mean a lot more customer can be able to afford it and a lot of reviews will be provided as a result of their experience with the project, which can be used to upgrade the mechanism, even more, to make it something better.
Above all else, this mechanism's most outstanding point is that it is meant to target customers that are too lazy and want a product that is very easy to use, which can be set and forgotten about in their household, and require little to no maintenance which will create less of a hassle for the customer. 

The intention for “Project Breeze” was always to create something that was able to help family homes regulate their home environment without paying a massive amount of money to create a ventilation system that could cost thousands of dollars, as a result of this “Breeze” was created to combat such an issue through the use of a cheap raspberry pi and some software, the project aims to create a system that allow your home to always be your desire temperature through the automation of your window/curtain and AC to function when the Raspberry pi sense that the temperature inside of your home is higher than the temperature from the outside or when you desire your house to always be at a certain temperature of your liking.



#### Tools and Technologies: 
The tools/equipment that I will be required for this project would be an electrical motor, small solar panel, digital thermal and Bluetooth hardware that will be able to sync and communicate action between the Raspberry PI and the object such as the AC and the electrical motor to help and adjust the temperature within the dedicated area. I would most likely be using software such as Java or Linux to be able to create the software that I will be using to control the function of  “the ventilator”. Other equipment that may also be necessary would be a digital device such as a laptop or PC, wires and screwdrivers to be able to create such a mechanism.

#### Skills Required: 
The necessary skill that will be required for this project would be someone that has vast knowledge about coding with Java or Linux, which would be needed to be able to create the main part of the program which will conduct all the calculations and necessary adjustments to the temperature when it is implemented. The hardware that we are using within the project has to be carefully constructed by combining different parts such as an electrical motor, digital thermistor and a small solar panel to be able to allow the mechanisms to work probably. This part would require someone with knowledge about how to wire and connect different parts together to make it function such as a mechanical engineer.

#### Outcome:
If project “Breeze” is successful the final outcome will be a product that has the ability to regulate the temperature of a home through a device such as a raspberry pi which will hopefully allow any customer to be able to regulate the temperature of their home through the use of a raspberry pi which is a cheap and affordable computer system. An obstacle that might hinder this project from being completed would probably be the way the mechanism would be merged together to produce a design that looks nice and appeal to the customer, without affecting the ability of “Breeze” to carry out its purpose.
